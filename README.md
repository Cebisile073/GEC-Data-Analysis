# 2007–2008 Financial Crisis

The 2007–2008 financial crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), was one of the most severe economic downturns in modern history. It originated in the United States but quickly spread to other parts of the world, leading to widespread financial turmoil, economic recession, and lasting consequences.

## Key Factors and Events

1. **Housing Bubble and Subprime Mortgages**: 
   - A significant increase in housing prices in the United States, fueled by easy access to credit and low-interest rates.
   - Lenders offered subprime mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories or low incomes, often with adjustable interest rates.

2. **Securitization and Financial Innovation**:
   - Banks bundled subprime mortgages into complex financial products known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).
   - These securities were sold to investors, spreading the risk throughout the financial system. 

3. **Credit Rating Agencies' Failure**: 
   - Credit rating agencies assigned high ratings to many securities, leading investors to believe they were safe investments.
   - Ratings failed to reflect the underlying risks, contributing to investor losses.

4. **Leverage and Overextension**:
   - Many financial institutions were highly leveraged, meaning they had borrowed heavily to finance their investments.
   - As the housing market declined, the value of securities plummeted, causing significant losses for these institutions.

5. **Bank Failures and Bailouts**:
   - Major financial institutions collapsed or were on the brink of collapse, necessitating government bailouts to stabilize the financial system.

6. **Global Economic Impact**:
   - The crisis spread globally, affecting economies around the world. Stock markets plunged, credit markets froze, and unemployment rates soared.
   - Many countries experienced severe recessions, with some facing sovereign debt crises.

7. **Policy Responses**:
   - Central banks implemented aggressive monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates and quantitative easing, to stimulate economic activity.
   - Governments enacted fiscal stimulus packages and implemented financial reforms to address the root causes of the crisis.

## Implications
- The crisis led to significant regulatory changes in the financial sector, changes in consumer behavior, and a lasting impact on global economic growth.
- It serves as a reminder of the dangers of excessive risk-taking, lax regulation, and the interconnectedness of the global financial system.
